First, Iâ€™ll use Pandas to load the simulated data into a data frame for analysis.
  
  
  
  Wait Time Analysis: Examine how wait times vary by drink type, preparation method (mobile vs. in-person), and peak hours to identify bottlenecks.
  Peak Hour Identification: Identify peak hours based on the volume of orders and wait times.
  Revenue Analysis: Examine the revenue generated during different times of the day and by drink type to identify high-value periods.



Recommendations for Management


a) Implement Mobile Order Optimization:
Finding: Mobile orders generally have shorter wait times. Encouraging more mobile orders can reduce in-store congestion during peak hours.
Recommendation: Promote the Starbucks mobile app by offering discounts or loyalty points for mobile orders during peak hours.



b) Staff Scheduling Adjustment:
Finding: Peak hours occur in the morning (7-9 AM), lunch (11-2 PM), and evening (5-7 PM), with longer wait times during these periods.
Recommendation: Increase staffing during these peak periods to handle the higher volume of orders more efficiently.


c) Menu Streamlining During Peak Hours:
Finding: Drinks like Frappuccinos and Mocha have longer prep times, contributing to longer wait times during busy hours.
Recommendation: Offer a limited menu during peak hours focusing on faster-to-prepare drinks like Coffee, Espresso, and Americano to reduce wait times.


d) Specialized Barista Roles:
Finding: Drinks with complex toppings or customizations add to prep time and overall wait time.
Recommendation: Assign dedicated baristas to handle complex orders like Frappuccinos and customized drinks to optimize preparation efficiency.


e) Increase Revenue with High-Value Drinks:
Finding: High-value drinks like Frappuccinos and special Mocha Frappuccinos bring in significant revenue despite their longer prep times.
Recommendation: Create premium drink promotions during non-peak hours to encourage higher revenue without overwhelming staff during busy times.
